# Short biography

I am now a fifth year Ph.D. student at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests focus on nonlinear partial differential equations, especially compressible Euler/Euler Poisson Equations with spherical symmetry; I am also interested in free boundary problems and characteristic discontinuities for hyperbolic conservation laws.
